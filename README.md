# README

* Install rvm
* Navigate to this folder again to load correct ruby and gemset
* Call `bundle install` and wait
* Call `rails db:reset` - this drops the db if exists, creates it again, and runs all migrations and seeds
* Run server with `rails s`

__note:__ this is a heavily unoptimized app, "large" collections may take some time to load :)
